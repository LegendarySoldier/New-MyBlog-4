            <h4>Fortnite</h4>
            <h3>Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking is a must in order to survive.</h3>

        <h4>Call of Duty-Mobile</h4>
        <h3>Call of Duty: Mobile is a free-to-play shooter video game developed by TiMi Studios and published by Activision and Garena for Android and iOS.Players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches in multiplayer mode.The multiplayer mode is like basic first person shooter, similar to Counter-Strike.The game also includes a battle royale mode featuring up to 100 players. A player can choose to play alone, on a two-man team, or in a four-man squad. At the start of a game, all players choose an ability from healing to making a launch pad. Once all 100 people are ready, they get aboard a plane that flies in a straight line over the map. This flight path changes every game. Every team is automatically given a jump leader who decides when and where the team will land.[19] At the beginning of the game, each player carries only a knife. The map is strewn with weapons, vehicles, and items which players can use to improve their chances of killing enemies while staying alive themselves. The safe zone on the map shrinks as the game progresses, with players who remain outside the zone being killed. A team wins the game if they are the last one remaining.A Zombies mode was added in November 2019. It placed teams of players against zombies that attacked in waves.</h3>
